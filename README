This was one of my first perl scripts, and as such it is badly
written. I wrote a while ago because the source code for
http://uiuccalendar.appspot.com/ was unavailable (at the time).

Right now the script is really buggy, and will not correctly convert
copy/pasted schedules correctly.

Your school/university most likely uses SunGard's Banner. Go to the
concise schedule page, copy/paste your schedule into the box, and click
"Convert it!"  The script will then serve you an .ics file, which you
can import into your favorite calendar app.

.ics files can be imported into in Google Calendar, Apple iCal, IBM
Lotus Notes, Yahoo! Calendar, Evolution (software) and maybe even
Microsoft Outlook.
